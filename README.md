# FBLA 2021 - 2022 Mobile Application Development

This GitHub repo will contain my source code for the competitive events. I'm not able to distribute the apps or export them as executables, so this is proof that it is my own work.

## About My Work

The main code base is in the 'Final Branch'. The 'master' branch was for experimentation.
I used these following plugins:
 - flutter and its SDK
 - flutter_svg
 - firebase_core
 - firebase_auth
 - cloud_firestore
 - provider
 - url_launcher
 - table_calendar
 - To see all other plugins look in the 'pubspec.yaml'
