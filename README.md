# FBLA 2021 - 2022 Mobile Application Development

This GitHub repo will contain the source code for my competitive event. I'm not able to distribute the apps or export them as executables. This is due to age restrictions on the app stores and tight protections from Apple and Google making it difficult to download apps from the internet. That being said, this repo is proof that the app is my work. I'm unsure if you will be able to run it due to problems with profiling, signing, and accounts. If you cannot, use the YouTube video linked in the Statement of Assurance PDF.

## About My Work

The main codebase is in the 'Final Branch'. The 'master' branch was for experimentation. If you can, download from the 'Final Branch' and run either the IOS or Android projects in their respective editors (Xcode or Android Studio)
I used these following plugins:
 - flutter and its SDK
 - flutter_svg
 - firebase_core
 - firebase_auth
 - cloud_firestore
 - provider
 - url_launcher
 - table_calendar
 - To see all other plugins look in the 'pubspec.yaml'
